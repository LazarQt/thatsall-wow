    <h5>Recruitment</h5>

    <div style="text-align: left; line-height: 175%;" class="os">

      We are looking for like-minded players for our Patch 10.2 raid roster.
      Our goal is to clear Heroic within the first few weeks, re-clear for gear and progress
      through Mythic at which point your character must be on our server.
      Our long term goal is to create a stable roster, defeat as many bosses as possible and create an environment where
      everyone feels at home (M+ enthusiasts welcome).
      <br>
      <br>
      If you think you are a good fit and want to join us, message ‘hazard’ on Discord.
      After successful recruitment feel free to look around and make yourself comfortable, there’s always plenty of
      banter and other shenanigans going on.

    <div style="text-align: left; line-height: 175%;" class="os">





      <div style="text-align: center;">You</div>

      <ul>
        <li> <b>Self-Critical</b> | Willing to use some time in between raids to reflect and identify grave mistakes so
          they can be avoided in the future</li>
        <li> <b>Knowledgeable in your domain</b> | Playing in a complex raid setting is muscle memory and if
          circumstances require you would be able to take on additional responsibilities</li>
        <li> <b>Focused and goal-driven</b> | You are motivated to keep pushing, setbacks don’t bother you as long as
          there is incremental progress </li>
      </ul>

      <div style="text-align: center;">Your character</div>
      <ul>
        <li> <b>Reasonable Min-Maxing</b> | Make sure to use the best available Enchantments, Sockets, Buff Food, Flasks
          and everything else in that category</li>
        <li> <b>Performance</b> | You play to the best of your ability, prioritizing mechanics and looking out for the
          troop. Making decisions based on parses and logs is completely unacceptable.</li>
        <li><b>Addons</b> | We may require specific WeakAura imports for certain bosses, everything else is up to your
          discretion (Should have either BigWigs or DBM)</li>

      </ul>
      <div style="text-align: center;">The Troop</div>
      <ul>
        <li> <b>Attendance</b> | We expect everyone to show up and be fully focused during raid hours as a sign of
          respect to everyone else that showed up. If you can’t make it occasionally just let us know beforehand so we
          can plan accordingly</li>
        <li> <b>Communication</b> | Must be able to listen in Discord. During encounters we reduce communication to a
          minimum but encourage discussions outside of it.</li>
        <li> <b>Interaction</b> | Humour encouraged, drama absolutely not allowed. </li>
      </ul>

      <div style="text-align: center;">Loot Rules</div>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Tier Pieces</b> | Roll Need for up to 2 until every player got 2 from raid, Need if upgrade after that (across all raid difficulties)</li>
        <li><b>Very Rare Items</b> | Roll Need <b>ONLY if BiS for main raid spec</b></li>
        <li><b>BoE's</b> | Will be sold for Guild Bank Gold (offering repairs, pots, food, ...)</li>
        <li><b>Everything else</b> | Roll Need if upgrade for your main raid spec regardless of endgame content you intend to use it in (Examples: Traditional DPS trinkets on Healers in M+, "Beacon to the Beyond" on any spec, ...). If in wrong loot spec for any reason or specced differently during encounters (asked to by raid lead, better spec for specific encounter, ...) make sure to contact raid lead immediately (in VC or chat) to ensure fair loot distribution as dictated by the rules.
        Beyond that, we trust your own judgement to decide whether or not a Need roll is necessary taking into account the overall stat increase and duration an item will be used before being replaced.</li>
        </li>
