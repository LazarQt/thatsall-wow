#Recruitment Message

Hi there. 
I am recruiting for Patch 10.2 Mythic progress (after Heroic clear) and wanted to know if you’d be interested in bolstering our current roster! We are a mature, light-hearted and wacky bunch with a semi-hardcore mindset and are looking for like-minded people to defeat bosses and have fun (in no particular order). 

If you consider yourself to be a talented CLASSNAME with the willingness to constantly improve and have great resolve while we tackle Amirdrassil we’d love to have you on board.
We value players who make sure to give their best and prepare well, in exchange we provide a drama free environment and give our best to lead the raid in a successful manner. 

Feel free to reply here or message me on discord @ ‘hazard’, see you!
