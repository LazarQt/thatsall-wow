# Extended Raid Group Notes and Ground Rules

\<Thats all folks> on Draenor EU is currently recruiting like-minded players for our Patch 10.2 raid roster. Our goal is to clear Heroic within the first few weeks, re-clear for gear and progress through Mythic at which point your character must be on our server. Our long term goal is to create a stable roster, defeat as many bosses on highest difficulty as possible and create an environment where everyone feels at home (M+ enthusiasts welcome). Raids are Monday & Wednesday 19:00-22:00 Server Time.

If you think you are a good fit and want to join us, message ‘hazard’ on Discord. After successful recruitment feel free to look around and make yourself comfortable, there’s always plenty of banter and other shenanigans going on. 

Our core values:

You

Self-Critical
Willing to use some time in between raids to reflect and identify grave mistakes so they can be avoided in the future
Knowledgeable in your domain
Playing in a complex raid setting is muscle memory and if circumstances require you would be able to take on additional responsibilities
Focused and goal-driven
You are motivated to keep pushing, setbacks don’t bother you as long as there is incremental progress


Your character

Reasonable Min-Maxing
Make sure to use the best available Enchantments, Sockets, Buff Food, Flasks and everything else in that category
Loot Rules
If a possible drop will not be replaced in foreseeable time through deterministic methods of acquisition and you’re able to make use of the item in any spec and/or endgame content, you may roll need (exception: Very rare drops)
Addons
We may require specific WeakAura imports for certain bosses, everything else is up to your discretion (Should have either BigWigs or DBM)

The Troop 

Attendance
We expect everyone to show up and be fully focused during raid hours as a sign of respect to everyone else that showed up. If you can’t make it occasionally just let us know beforehand so we can plan accordingly
Communication
Must be able to listen in Discord. During encounters we reduce communication to a minimum but encourage discussions outside of it.
Interaction with other members
Humour encouraged, drama absolutely not allowed.
